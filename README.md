# Ngeakish
"ngeakish", not to be confused with "Ngeakish", is a language born out of the depths of Kingshots translating feature. It all started with "ngeak" which translates to the wonderful and versatile word "Fuck". After that - the hunt began. Hours were spent in the Alliance Chat and DMs to find new words and variations, even sentences started to form. Lists have been shared, copied and expanded. To bring some order to the chaos, we created this project.

As the name beautifully implies, ngeakish ignores the rules of the translator and you can sneak some swear words in, which you would otherwise not be allowed to use.

The language is **case-sensitive**! So if a letter is capitalised, that's for a reason.

Now you may think "ngini nggak ngek", and that's okay. But please don't be _ngrak_ about it, we are just having fun and are _ngakak_. And if you don't get that, _ngenge ngu_.

## Findings
_Copied from notes in AC_
- `nggak` triggers a negation
- `ngi` triggers a first person pronoun identifier
- `ngeak` initiates a question when its paired with `ngek`
- `ngga` - no*
- `ngek` - funny / good*
- `ngini` - this*

_*not literal translations_

## Honorable mentions
While not exactly ngeakish, those are still interesting
| Word | Translation |
| --- | --- |
| hngh | Hey there |
| hnghh | Good night |
| gd mrng | god is dying |

Also with some creative characters you can even openly swear: `Fucَk`

_Please be nice to each other! :)_
